# Data Scientist

## Purpose

*  To provide insights, using various datasets, to the organisation to inform strategic and operational decisions and ultimately provide benefits to all of the residents of Cape Town

## Overview

*  The Data Scientist works closely with the Data Science team to:

   * apply their knowledge and experience in statistics, mathematics, programming, and business to extract meaningful insights and solve complex problems from large and diverse datasets. 

   * gather relevant data from various sources, which may include databases, APIs, web scraping, or even manual data entry. 

   * apply machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to develop models that can make predictions or classify data. 

   * evaluate different models, perform parameter tuning, and assess their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

   * deliver reproducible datasets and analytical models.
  
   * effectively communicating findings and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

   * help structure tasks and deliver them within agreed timeframes.

* The Data Scientist must at least have an understanding and proficiency of scripting languages (R and Python)

## Skills needed

* Statistical Knowledge: a solid understanding of statistical concepts and techniques. 

* Proficiency in Programming: skilled in programming languages commonly used in data science, such as Python or R. Familiarity with SQL for database querying is also beneficial.

* Data Manipulation and Analysis: proficient in handling and transforming large datasets. Able to extract, clean, and preprocess data from various sources, using techniques like data wrangling, feature engineering, and data imputation.

* Machine Learning and Deep Learning: solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques. Knowledge of deep learning techniques and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

* Data Visualisation: able to effectively communicate insights and findings through visualisations. Skilled in using data visualisation libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, ggplot) to create clear and compelling visual representations of data.

* Business Knowledge: understand the business context to frame problems correctly, select appropriate features, and interpret results in a meaningful way.

* Problem-Solving Skills: strong analytical and problem-solving skills.  Need to be able to break down complex problems and identify relevant patterns and insights.

* Communication and Storytelling: effective communication to convey technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. Able to present findings and insights in a clear and understandable manner, using visualisations and narratives to tell a compelling data-driven story.

* Collaboration and Teamwork: work as part of a team, collaborating with other data scientists, analysts, engineers, product manager and business stakeholders.  Work effectively in a team environment, contribute to discussions, and share knowledge and insights with colleagues.

* Continuous Learning: data science is a rapidly evolving field, and data scientists need to stay updated with the latest tools, techniques, and methodologies. They should be proactive in learning new skills, exploring emerging technologies, and keeping up with industry trends.

* Resilience: ability to respond constructively to pressure / stress situations and the ability to persist with goals despite obstacles and setbacks.

* Client Orientation: understand the service needs of clients or stakeholders, and actively focus on anticipating, meeting, and exceeding their needs in a timely and appropriate manner.

## Typical projects the Data Analyst will work on

* Develop risk models to indicate where resources must focus their efforts, e.g. infrastrucutre, safety & security, etc.

* Use satellite imagery to identify objects or changes on the ground.

* Extract content from internal documents that can help with questions.

* And many more ...
